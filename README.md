* You can trun off your device for now
* You must be online at your turn when the queue ends
* You should not close `Browser` and `Terminal` while contributing to Ceremony
* Wait for your computer to contribute to the ceremony. As long as the terminal shows “Awaiting orders…”, you’re still in queue.
* Once your computer begins contributing, the browser will switch to “starting contribution”, followed by “contributing”, and finally “verifying”. As long as all necessary programs are running, and the browser tab shows one of these messages, your computer is contributing.
* The average time for each contribution is 5-30 minutes, and can take as long as 1 hour.
